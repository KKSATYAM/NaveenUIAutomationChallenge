## Release types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v19.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v19.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
